        <P>
          Silent Support is a quiet place to check in with how you feel. This page explains, plainly,
          what we do and don’t do with your information. No legal maze, just the truth.
        </P>

        <H>What Silent Support is</H>
        <P>
          Silent Support lets you tap how you’re feeling and receive a calm, supportive response.
          Sometimes a gentle line, sometimes a breathing space. It’s built to be private and
          low-pressure. No feeds, no followers, nothing public.
        </P>

        <H>What we store</H>
        <P>We keep this as small as possible.</P>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>Your check-ins.</Text> The emotion you tap, and when. When you’re
          signed out, these are stored only on your device. (To write a response, the emotion you tapped
          is sent to our AI service in the moment, and is not saved — see “The services we rely on”.)
        </Bullet>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>Your email.</Text> Only if you choose to create an account. We
          use it to send your sign-in code and to back up your check-ins. There are no passwords.
        </Bullet>
        <P>We don’t ask for your name, age, location, contacts, or anything else.</P>

        <H>How we use it</H>
        <Bullet>To show your history, so you can look back gently.</Bullet>
        <Bullet>To keep it safe across your devices, only when you’re signed in.</Bullet>
        <P>We never use it to profile you or build a picture of who you are.</P>
        <P>
          Silent Support never knows why you chose an emotion. Only the emotion itself is processed.
        </P>

        <H>Gentle patterns, only on your phone</H>
        <P>
          Sometimes the app quietly notices a pattern. It might show a soft line like “you’ve been
          checking in consistently lately” (a memory whisper), or, if difficult feelings seem to be
          lasting, a gentle reminder that support resources are always there (a support nudge).
        </P>
        <P>
          Both are worked out only on your device, from check-ins already on your phone. They are never
          sent anywhere, never stored separately, and are not a diagnosis, an assessment, or any kind of
          monitoring.
        </P>

        <H>Signed out vs signed in</H>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>Signed out:</Text> nothing about you is stored on our servers, and
          your history stays on your device. To write a response, the single emotion you tap is sent to
          our AI service in the moment and never saved.
        </Bullet>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>Signed in:</Text> your check-ins are backed up to your private
          account, so they’re safe if you lose or change your phone.
        </Bullet>

        <H>The services we rely on</H>
        <P>We’re a small app and use a few trusted services to run:</P>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>Supabase.</Text> Handles sign-in and stores signed-in users’
          check-ins in a secure database. Each person’s data is locked to their own account.
        </Bullet>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>SendGrid.</Text> Sends your sign-in code by email. It only
          handles your email address to deliver that one message.
        </Bullet>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>Groq.</Text> Generates some supportive responses using AI. It
          receives only two things: the single emotion you tapped (like “Lonely”), and a coarse
          support-strength number from 1 to 3 that hints how much support to offer. That number is
          worked out on your device — your history, counts, dates, and emotional patterns never leave
          your phone. Groq never receives your email or anything that identifies you, and many responses
          are pre-written and don’t use AI at all.
        </Bullet>

        <H>Technical basics</H>
        <P>
          Like any app that connects to the internet, the services we rely on briefly see your device’s
          IP address and the time of each request, in order to deliver a response. Silent Support does
          not use this to track, profile, or build a picture of you.
        </P>
        <P>
          Your phone’s app store may send anonymous crash reports (handled by Apple or Google, never an
          analytics tool inside the app) to help us fix problems; you can turn this off in your device
          settings.
        </P>

        <H>Your data is yours, and locked to you</H>
        <P>
          For signed-in users, every check-in is tied to your account, and only you can read it. No
          other person, and no request without your sign-in, can reach it. We don’t read your
          check-ins ourselves; they’re simply kept for you. This is enforced at the database level,
          not just in the app.
        </P>

        <H>Deleting your data</H>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>Signed out:</Text> clearing your history in the app removes those
          check-ins from your device.
        </Bullet>
        <Bullet>
          <Text style={styles.strong}>Signed in:</Text> clearing your history removes your check-ins
          from your account and this phone. To remove everything, go to Settings, then Account, and tap
          Delete account. This permanently removes your account and every backed-up check-in right
          away, and clears them from this device. It can’t be undone. (Signing out instead just clears
          this device and keeps your check-ins safe in your account.)
        </Bullet>

        <H>How long we keep things</H>
        <Bullet>
          Your check-ins stay until you delete them. We don’t auto-expire them or archive them
          elsewhere.
        </Bullet>
        <Bullet>
          When you clear your history while signed in, we keep only a random ID for each cleared
          check-in (never how you felt or when), so an older copy can’t bring it back. These IDs are
          removed when you delete your account.
        </Bullet>
        <Bullet>Deleting your account removes your account and every backed-up check-in.</Bullet>
        <Bullet>
          The services we rely on may keep their own short-lived logs (for example, of sign-in emails or
          logins) for a time, according to their own policies.
        </Bullet>

        <H>What we don’t do</H>
        <Bullet>We don’t sell or share your data with anyone.</Bullet>
        <Bullet>We don’t run ads.</Bullet>
        <Bullet>We don’t use tracking or analytics tools.</Bullet>
        <Bullet>We don’t have social features or anything public.</Bullet>
        <Bullet>We don’t read your check-ins for any purpose other than showing them back to you.</Bullet>
        <P>Your emotional data isn’t a product. It’s just yours.</P>

        <H>Comfort, not medicine</H>
        <P>
          Silent Support is here for comfort, not medical care or therapy, and it can’t replace a
          real person.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you’re in danger or thinking about hurting yourself, please reach out to your local
          emergency services or a helpline in the Help screen. You shouldn’t have to carry that alone.
        </P>

        <H>Questions</H>

          If anything here is unclear, email {SUPPORT_EMAIL} and we’ll help.
