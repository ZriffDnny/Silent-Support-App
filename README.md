# Silent Support

A private emotional space that helps you express feelings when you don’t have the energy to explain them.

## 🧠 Vision

Silent Support is built for moments when emotions feel heavy, but words feel impossible.

Instead of typing long messages or talking to someone, you simply tap how you feel — and receive calm, grounding support instantly.

No conversations.
No social pressure.
No explanations required.

Just emotional release → gentle response → quiet recovery.

## 💡 Core Idea

One tap is enough.

You select how you feel:

- 😔 Bad Day
- 🌧 Feeling Low
- 😴 Emotionally Exhausted
- 💭 Overthinking
- 🫂 Need Comfort
- 🌱 Need Encouragement
- ❤️ Lonely
- ⚡ Anxiety Spike

The app responds with:

- A calm, validating message
- Optional breathing or grounding exercise
- A safe space to pause

---

## 🎯 Problem

When people feel overwhelmed, they often cannot:

- Explain what’s wrong
- Talk to others
- Form full sentences
- Ask for help

Silent Support removes the need for explanation.

---

## 🧘 Target Users

- People with anxiety
- Emotionally overwhelmed users
- Introverts
- People dealing with loneliness
- Anyone experiencing emotional burnout
- Users who struggle to express feelings

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. Emotional Tap System

One-tap emotion selection.

No typing required.

---

### 2. AI Emotional Companion

A calm presence that responds with:

- Validation
- Presence
- Emotional grounding

Not a therapist.
Not a coach.
Not a chatbot.

Just a steady presence.

**Presence over intelligence.** A gentle, human-written message appears the instant you tap — never a loading spinner. The AI works quietly in the background; if it answers in time, it softly deepens the response, and if it’s slow or unavailable, the written one simply stays. You always get something calm, instantly, even offline.

---

### 3. Comfort Mode

A dedicated calm screen with:

- Breathing animation (inhale · hold · exhale)
- Grounding prompts
- Optional ambient sound
- Silence mode (one tap strips everything away but the breath)
- Gentle reset experience

---

### 4. Emotion History

A soft, private record of how you’ve felt:

- What you felt and when
- A gentle “lately” summary and light, rule-based reflections
- Filter by feeling

This is an emotional mirror, **not** a health tracker — no charts, scores, diagnoses, or labels.

---

## 🔒 Privacy

Privacy is the product, not a setting.

- **Local-first.** Your emotion history lives on your device. Signed out, no check-ins or account are stored on any server; to write a response, only the feeling you tapped and a 1-to-3 depth number pass through our server to the AI provider, and we don't keep them.
- **Accounts are optional.** Create one only if you want to back up and sync across devices. Sign-in is a simple emailed code — no password, no magic link.
- **You own your data.** Clear your history any time, or delete your account entirely (which erases your data from the server).
- **No tracking.** No third-party analytics SDKs.

---

## 🧠 AI Philosophy

The AI must always:

- Validate before anything else
- Stay short and calm
- Avoid advice unless asked
- Avoid overwhelming the user
- Never judge or analyze deeply

Example responses:

- “That sounds heavy. I’m here with you.”
- “You don’t need to explain this right now.”
- “Let’s slow down for a moment.”

These rules are enforced on both sides: a constrained prompt, and a server-side check that strips anything off-tone (advice, questions, emojis, toxic positivity) before it ever reaches you.

---

## 🆘 Safety

A built-in **Help** screen links crisis resources (Malaysia plus an international directory). Silent Support is a moment of calm, not a substitute for professional or emergency help.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Mobile
- React Native (Expo, expo-router)
- TypeScript (strict)

### Backend
- Supabase — Auth (email OTP), Postgres + Row-Level Security, Edge Functions (Deno)

### AI
- Groq (OpenAI-compatible API), called from a Supabase Edge Function

---

## 🧱 Current Scope

This is a SOLO MODE app.

There are:

❌ No friends
❌ No messaging
❌ No social features
❌ No notifications
❌ No gamification

Only:

✔ Emotional expression
✔ Instant grounding response (curated, with optional AI depth)
✔ Private, local-first emotional tracking
✔ Optional account for backup & sync

---

## 🎯 Product Goal

To become the easiest way for someone to say:

> “I don’t feel okay”  
without needing to explain why.

---

## 🚀 Status

Active development — the core solo loop (tap → instant response → comfort mode), private history, optional accounts, and safety resources are in place.
