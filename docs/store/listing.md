```
Silent Support is a quiet place to check in with how you feel — no journaling, no pressure, no audience.

Tap a single emotion and receive a calm, supportive response in the same breath. Some moments call for a gentle line; others for a slow breath together. That's all it ever asks of you.

WHY IT FEELS DIFFERENT
• One tap — no need to explain, write, or justify how you feel.
• A calm response the instant you check in. No loading spinner, no chatbot, no back-and-forth.
• Comfort Mode: a simple breathing space for when words are too much, with optional ambient sound (ocean, rain, forest, brown noise, or gentle haptics).
• A gentle, private history, so you can look back without judgement.

PRIVATE BY DESIGN
• No ads. No tracking. No analytics. Ever.
• Works without an account — your check-ins are stored only on your phone.
• Optional free backup with just your email and a sign-in code (no passwords).
• Your check-ins are yours alone, locked to your account, and deletable anytime.
• To write a response, only the emotion you tapped and a coarse 1–3 sense of how much support to offer are sent to our AI service, through our server. Your history, counts, dates, identity, and the reason behind a feeling are never sent to it.
• Silent Support never knows why you chose an emotion.

GENTLE, NOT CLINICAL
A companion for everyday feelings — not a coach, not a tracker that nags, not a service that scores you. No streaks, no badges, no guilt-trip notifications. Just a moment of calm, whenever you need one.

A KIND WORD WHEN IT'S HEAVY
If something is sitting heavy, support resources are always one tap away in the Help screen.

Silent Support is here for comfort, not medical care or therapy, and it can't replace a real person. If you're in danger or thinking about hurting yourself, please reach out to your local emergency services or a helpline.

Check in. Breathe. Let go.

## Keywords (Apple, ≤100 — comma-separated, no spaces, no app-name repeats)

```
mood,feelings,emotions,check-in,calm,breathe,journal,diary,selfcare,mindful,private,grounding,stress
```
— exactly 100 ✅

- Apple auto-combines single words into phrases ("mood journal", "private diary"); keep them single.
- Optional swaps by ranking: `wellbeing`, `journaling`, `reflect`, `quiet`, `vent`.
- **Do not** add brand terms (Calm, Headspace) or treatment terms (`therapy`, `depression`, `disorder`, `treatment`).

## Categories

- **Apple primary: Health & Fitness** — where users search for calm / mood / mindfulness apps; accepts non-clinical wellbeing apps.
- **Apple secondary: Lifestyle** — safe, non-medical fallback.
- **Avoid: Medical** — implies diagnosis/treatment and triggers heightened review.
- **Google Play:** Category **Health & Fitness**; self-care / mindfulness framing. Complete the Data Safety form (see checklist).

## Privacy positioning

**Headline:** *Private by design — no ads, no tracking, no analytics, and no account required.*

Accurate claims (consistent with `app/privacy.tsx`):
- No advertising, tracking, or analytics SDKs (verified — none in the codebase).
- Signed out: check-ins are stored only on the device; no check-ins or account are stored on our
  servers.
- Signed in (optional): the email and the check-ins (emotion + time) are stored in the account for
  backup and sync. Account data is owner-locked at the database level and fully deletable in-app
  (email + one-time code, no passwords).
- Every user, signed in or not: the tapped emotion + a coarse 1–3 support level are sent through our
  server to the AI provider (Groq) to generate a response. Our code doesn't store them. Groq says it
  doesn't retain them by default but may keep them up to 30 days for troubleshooting or abuse checks.
  No history, identity, or reason is sent.
- Emotional data is never sold, shared for advertising, or used to profile.

**Do NOT claim:** "fully offline", "nothing ever leaves your device", "never stored anywhere", or "no
data collected" without qualification (an account collects email + check-ins for functionality, the AI
call transmits the tapped emotion + the 1–3 level, and the services log network metadata such as IP
addresses). See the Privacy Label / Data Safety checklists for the exact label setup.

## Competitive positioning

**One-liner:** *Most apps want you to log, track, score, or chat. Silent Support just wants to be there — one tap, one calm breath, kept private.*

| Versus | They lean on | Silent Support's wedge |
|---|---|---|
| Mood trackers (Daylio, MoodNotes) | charts, scores, streaks, data entry | one tap; no scoring, no streaks, no pressure |
| Meditation apps (Calm, Headspace) | long sessions, subscriptions, libraries | instant in-the-moment comfort; no commitment |
| Journaling apps (Reflectly, Stoic) | writing prompts, daily entries | no writing required — feelings without words |
| AI wellness chatbots (Wysa, Woebot) | conversational, quasi-clinical framing | presence over intelligence; explicitly non-clinical |

**Three differentiators to repeat everywhere:**
1. Lowest possible friction — one tap, no account, no journaling.
2. Genuinely private — local-first, no tracking/ads/analytics, account optional, fully deletable.
3. Calm, not clinical — comfort and presence, never diagnosis, coaching, or gamified pressure.
